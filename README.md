## Run Scripts

To run the project, you need to run `backend` and `frontend` 
Also you need to have MONGO, but it's (optional). I've point my own MONGO for some time.

### Backend
Go to backend: 
 - #### `npm install`
 - #### `npm start`

### Frontend
Go to frontend: 
 - #### `npm install`
 - #### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001) to view it in the browser.
